### Introduction

Surf Punk is one of the simplest genres of music there is. However, when mixed correctly, it acquires a highly energetic sound which can get all audience members in a moshpit in no time. Therefore, learning how to mix it well is very important! Luckily, just like writing a Surf Punk song, the process itself isn't too difficult. This is how to mix for a deliciously energetic one.

#### Materials

-  **DAW**.
    - *GarageBand* and *FL Studio* are both very easy DAW's for beginners to get into.
- **Song recording**.
    - If not recorded within your DAW, it should be split by parts. i.e. a different audio file for every instrument part.
- **Open-back monitor headphones**.
    - Every speaker system sounds different. These provide the most accurate, device-independent sound.

#### Notes

- Music is highly personal. It is encouraged to use these instructions as reference only; the final mix should be yours!
- Keep your audio levels in control. **Protecting your hearing as a musician is essential**. Use <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> volume at all times if possible.
- Because there are many DAW's, some familiarity with your preferred one is required.
- You are expected to have working knowledge of musical arrangement and recording.

*The GarageBand DAW. To the left are the different audio tracks, to the right are the views of such tracks, and at the top are different controls/settings*.

1. In your DAW, **create the necessary audio tracks** to place each part of your recording into.
    - There should be at least one track per instrument part
    - For drum sets, it's recommended to record each drum separately and use a track for each one; i.e. one track for your snare drum, another for your kick drum, etc.
2. Go to each track's plugin chain and **organize it**. 
    - It's important to apply effects plugins in the correct order. Here's a recommended one for Surf Punk using the more common effects, organized from first to last:
        <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; `Noise Gate`<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; `Channel EQ`<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; `Compressor/Limiter`<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; `Effects Pedalboard`<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; `Amp Modeler`<br>
    - *Note*: You don't need to make use of all these effects! The only ones this guide uses are `Noise Gate`, `Channel EQ`, `Amp Modeler`, and `Effects Pedalboard`.

You are encouraged to experiment with other settings and plugins.

#### Glossary

- **DAW**: *Digital Audio Workstation*; software used to record, mix, and master songs.
- **Mix**: A combination of audio that achieves a specific sound.
- **Track**: Stores sound recordings. We superimpose tracks to create songs!
- **Plugin**: Modifier applied to track in order to change its sound.
- **Amplifier**: Amplifies the sound produced by electric/bass guitar strings.
- **Amp Modeler**: Simulates the sound of a real electric/bass guitar amplifier.
- **Noise Gate**: Plugin; removes audio levels below a threshold to remove noise.
- **Compressor**: Plugin; lowers loud sounds and increases quiet sounds, as specified by the user.
- **Limiter**: Plugin; cuts audio that surpasses a certain threshold.
- **Reverb**: Effect; gives sounds smooth delay.
- **Overdrive**: Effect; distorts sound.
- **Frequency**: Pitch.
- **Channel EQ**: Per-channel frequency equalization.
    - Audio is composed of different frequencies that go from low to high pitch.
        - **Bass** = low pitch.
        - **Mid** = mid pitch.
        - **High/Treble** = high pitch.
    - A rule of thumb is:
        - **More bass, less treble** = heavier, more immersive
        - **Less bass, more treble** = thinner, more mellow.
- **EQ Band**: Adjuster that increases/decreases loudness of specific EQ frequency range.
- **Audio Clipping**: Distortion caused by excessive loudness levels.

### Steps

1. **Apply effects.**
    - Use the various plugins for each track to modify the sound of each track. For Surf Punk, use the sound guideline provided previously. But remember, *experimentation is key!*
    - To obtain a Surf Punk sound, use:
        - `Overdrive`: This will make your instruments sound more distorted, which is characteristic of punk rock.
        - `Reverb`: This will add a touch of smooth delay to your instruments. It will make them sound surfier!
        - *Note*: It's also recommended to remove any effects on your amp modeler for a clean tone; this is characteristic of surf songs.

2. **Adjust the volume of your tracks.**
    - Make sure every track:
        - Sounds balanced alongside all others (not too loud or too quiet)
        - Your overall mix volume isn't too loud! Your DAW will let you know when this happens by displaying red in your master volume.
    - You may need to tweak the parameters of certain effects to ensure a more balanced sound.

3. **Apply track equalization**
    - Go into each track's EQ plugin and adjust each band. For a quality mix:
        - Make sure each instrument emphasizes a distinct range of frequencies. This will allow you to make everything louder and sound less muddy. For Surf Punk:
            - **Bass guitars** should live in the low frequencies; around *80Hz*.
            - **Rhythm guitars** should live in mid frequencies; around *1kHz*.
            - **Lead guitars** should live in mid to high frequencies; around *2-3kHz*.
            - Drum parts vary!
                - **Snare drums** should live at around *100Hz*.
                - **Kick drums** should live at around *30-60Hz*. **Be careful!** Kick drums have powerful bass sounds and can create a muddy mix.
                - **Cymbals** should live at around *10-20kHz.* **Be careful!** Loud cymbals can create very high-pitched noise which can strain the ears.
    - Think of this like a **puzzle**. Every instrument's frequencies should go into their corresponding spot in the whole song.
    - A rule of thumb is to EQ as little as possible. **Always try to get as good a mix as possible in step 2 before you EQ!**

4. **Apply master effects & EQ.** Once your mix is complete, you may want to make the final mix sound different, perhaps by increasing or reducing bass, or adding an effect to the whole song.
    - Apply any wanted plugins to the master track.
    - Then, adjust EQ bands like in step 2 to get the result you want. Remember; trial and error!
        - Generally, one complaint with mixes towards the end is that they're *too quiet*. To fix this, you may want to use a limiter plugin, which allows you to increase loudness but not let it surpass a certain threshold.
5. **Test and repeat.** Once you're happy with your mix, export it as a sound file and test it out on different speakers.
    - **You are more than likely to find that it doesn't sound good on everything.** That's perfectly normal!
    - If this is the case, go back to each necessary step and tweak settings as needed. **Test it as many times as you need to!** Mixing is an art of trial and error.

*There are many kinds of speaker systems, each sounding slightly differently! Test your mix on as many different ones as you have access to.*

### Conclusion

After following these steps, you should have an effective, poweful Surf Punk mix. Remember, music is art, and is very subjective. Experiment as much as possible and make your mix sound *yours*!
