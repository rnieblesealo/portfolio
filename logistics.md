### Project Questions

How is it coming along thus far?

    I like my progress so far. I've worked out an easy way to write my as 
    if it were only a text file, so adding/removing things is very easy.
    All I really have left to do is finish the writing parts and adding images!

Are you happy with your page layouts, ease of navigation, and color scheme?

    Yes; everything's very easy with the pipeline I've chosen to work with
    for both visitors to the site and myself working on it. The site is easy
    to navigate and uses a theme that I'm happy with.

Are the fonts clear and easy to read?

    Yes, everything has the appropriate sizing and contrast.

What have you learned through the process of creating this digital portfolio?

    I have learned how to easily set up simple websites that can serve for a variety
    of purposes, and gotten my feet wet with web development and website hosting.

What questions do you have?

    None, everything is going smoothly thus far.

Which aspects are difficult or confusing?

    At the beginning, the most "difficult" thing was to get the website set up.
    But it didn't take much reading to do so! Other than that, everything's been
    smooth sailing.

What resources might you use to assist you?

    I've used online developer forums to assist me mostly, as well as documentation
    related to the tools that I'm using.
