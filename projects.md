# Projects

These are some writing projects I developed for ENC3241!

## Instructions

This assignment focused on writing a detailed guide on how to carry out a task. Given that I work on music on the side, I chose to do mine on mixing! Writing instructions is an essential task in the world of professional writing, and I believe it's important to work on it as much as one can. As a software person, proper documentation with good instructions can make a ***tremendous*** difference!

## Research Proposal

</p>

This other writing assignment focused on drafting a professional research proposal that is presentable to an academic organization to actually conduct what it details. Because I'm a software person and I'm frequently following the more informal side of the field, I know there's a very big controversy regarding whether schools teach the right things to students working in software fields. My research proposal establishes a research scheme which would help us quantitatively measure how true this is!

Believe it or not, this website is also a really important project I developed! It's designed to show myself off professionally and make a workable resume-style website for real interviews, just like a professional website should. In the home page, you'll also find a resume/CV I drafted in the style that I'd use for real-world job applications. You can find them in the navigation bar above, or click below!
