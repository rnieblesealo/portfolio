### How Much of the Knowledge Needed By the Workforce Are Information Technology/Computer Science Students Being Taught?

#### Project Objective

This project aims to survey IT/CS students and workforce employees as two separate populations in order to qualitatively identify which tools (e.g. C++, Rust, Docker, etc.) and skills (e.g. teamwork, ability to work under pressure, etc.) are considered most useful in the workforce and which ones are actually taught to students *(Creswell, John W).* The study will ask a sample of students for single keywords describing the skills they are learning, and a sample of employees which skills they actively use in the real world in order to draw a descriptive comparison, demonstrating whether there is any contrast between what's used vs. what's taught. 

#### Project Background and Significance

Competent IT/CS students are vital in the coming future where artificial intelligence will most likely gain the ability to carry out the more mundane tasks of software development (See GitHub Copilot, for example). As such, it is likely that the field will only become lucrative to more seasoned engineers who are able to use their knowledge to solve more complex problems. It is therefore vital that students going into the field learn skills they will actually use. This study aims to show whether this is being done correctly *(Haque, Waqar)*. 

#### Research Methods

The survey will be conducted through Google Forms. A random sample of undergraduate IT/CS students and software engineers working at diverse companies are to be given such survey, which will ask IT/CS students the abilities that they are learning and workforce members the abilities that they most frequently use in the workforce.

Both populations will enter their answers as a comma-separated list of keywords. Once the data has been collected, it will be passed to a cleanup program, which will normalize the input (getting rid of typos, meaningless characters such as whitespace, etc) and simply leave a list of **single words in lowercase** pertaining to each population's sample *(Kahmen, Heribert., and Wolfgang)*. 

Once the data is cleaned up, it will be compiled into **two sorted bar graphs**, which will display the frequency of each keyword that was collected. Both finalized graphs' most frequent 20 keywords will be compared in this sorted order, from which descriptive comparisons will be drawn *(Clowes, S. K. (Steve K.), and Dawn Duke)*.

Based on such comparisons, the initial question will be answered using a percentage based on how many of the keywords answered by students made it into the top 20 keywords answered by workforce members.

$p = \dfrac{K_s}{20} \times 100$, where $K_s =$ number of keywords matching between students and engineers.

A complete list of matching and mismatched keywords will also accompany this score, organized using two columns, *match* and *mismatch*.

#### Expected Outcome

After completing the initial research, the $p$ percentage collected should numerically state how synchronized IT/CS student curriculums are when compared to what's actually in demand within the workforce. 

The findings will be documented in a scholarly article, providing a more in-depth explanation of the data, how it was collected, what it signifies, and what should be done with it in mind.

Its findings will also be presented to UCF students aspiring to go into the fields of IT/CS, in order to bring awareness as to what their career environment currently looks like.

If the $p$ value collected happens to be low, it should imply a call to action for institutions to modify their curriculums in order to more accurately match students' expected skillsets with that which is actually required. The list of match/mismatch should help provide a guideline into how to do this; however, instructors and program directors are expected to go more in-depth regarding their approach, given that this study should not be the only source of information. 

If it is higher, then it signifies that IT/CS undergraduate programs are in sync with what is needed by the industry. These conclusions are subjective and the action taken regarding them depends on the interpretation of the reader.

#### Preliminary Work and Experience

As a Computer Science student who is up to date with both the curriculum and the industry and follows several individuals who work within it as engineers, I understand both sides of the spectrum. Additionally, I am also an active participant in the development of artificial intelligence, and have great awareness of both the pace of its development and what it will mean for developers in the future. This awareness is shared by the members of the industry that I follow, and reasons my belief that there is a need for more seasoned developers able to solve more complex problems that artificial intelligence is still far away from being able to solve.

I am also familiar with diverse statistical methodologies, and understand how to use them as a tool to conduct a study such as this one. However, given that I haven't conducted a large-scale survey study such as this one, it is still advisable to take its results with a grain of salt and draw personal interpretations from the data that it is to expose.
